Test program
Main objective of the present investigation was to study performance of ESP concretes  in terms of strength  with normal water curing and with no chemical admixtures in the  mixes .performance of the concretes was assessed througth compressive strength water absorption and sorption
3.1 Fineness test of cement
We determine the proportion of cement whose grained size is lerger than specific mesh size here 90 micron sieve is taken procedur
1)Take a sample of cement and rub the cement with your hand the test sample should  be free of lumb 
2)Now ,take  100g of ESP and note it as W1
3)Pour 100g of ESP in 90 micron sieve and close it with the lid
4)Now place the sieve in sieve shaking machine but here we shake it with our one hands with liner movement for 15 min.
5)Nest ,wt the resi due retained on the 90 Mic sieve as w2
6)Than ,calculate the % of wt of ESP retained by formula
        %  of wt ESP retained on sieve = W2 /W!x100
        Here our fineness get 90% which is good.
